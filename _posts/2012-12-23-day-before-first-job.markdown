Picture of the company that I had was serious and formal staff, surrounded with dull colours, strict boss and limited freedom. Non of this applies to ‘Embrace’. I landed in bangalore a day before the joining and dropped by at my working place. A seemingly nice place to work at. I instantly felt comfortable and hope it will be great fun.

I was taken around the office, got introduced with everyone. I was feeling what every new comer feels. I am now naturally excited to get started into another phase of life. Till now was the period of dreams and now comes the ‘action’ part. Here is the chance to prove your existence to the world and make the best out of every opportunity that life gifts. This is the part of life where ‘Life is What You Make it’ and you cannot blame anybody but you for outcomes.

I hope I don’t get settled down, but keep up my desire to be a great person one day and constantly work towards it.

See you guys in the next post :)
