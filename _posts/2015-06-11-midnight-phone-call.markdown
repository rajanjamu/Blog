What if I told you that you are not allowed to speak to any opposite gender anytime after evening, forget face to face, not even a phone call.

I don't know if I have become so called 'modern', left behind all the so called 'sanskriti', and become arrogant, or our so called 'shaastras' need ammendments.

Dear parents, do you fear that your teenage son or daughter would hang on a wrong line, pick up bad habits and ruin your name? And this fear makes you believe that if you control him or her, everything will be alright. Yes, I understand that you can mould anybody in their tender age, for them to become a great person someday, but we have probably got that age wrong? If you really believed in your teachings, which you have been promoting since he/she came into bright light, you wouldn't be afraid. You would be confident about them. Even when we talk about management, great leaders give their team an open but restricted ground to play around, which is a balance of control and freedom. Teen age is when you probably should give them a ground and not a room.

Anyways, I do not yet have perspective from the other side and hence cannot jump to conclusions. I am sure parents would have a good logic as they speak from their experience, having been there at that stage.

Just a thought, what would your response be to, "Society has killed more dreams than anything else in the world".
