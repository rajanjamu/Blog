Today I am very happy. The stress I have been living with for so many days is over. The stress of making my dreams true, tension of how I will get there and worriness of what would happen if I jump. And for this, I must say thanks to my own society which has helped me come to this stage. It has trully given me confidence that I cannot achieve what I want to. I have finally realized that I was born to be what my parents and relatives want me to be. A part of me is sad that I wasted precious years of my life dreaming about how I want to see this world. But that's ok. You have to loose something to achieve something.

Today, I feel as if I am a free bird, ready to take orders, be a follower and see the world as it would be without me. Society has answered a question that has been troubling me for years, and that is,"What is the purpose of my existence?". You live to be what your society has imagined the day you were born. You are here to help us, support us, die with us, no matter what happens to this world. We have given you life, food, water, shelter and this is the time for you to pay it back.

I wish this happens to everybody on this planet, live happy life and let the world go where it wants to be, without making a dent in the universe. No dent, no damage.

Happy following !
