Ring Ring. Hello! I need to get my clothes washed and utensils cleaned and would take around 4 hours. And in next few moments, a trained ‘Bai’ arrives with all necessary things to fullfil your requirements for the stated time.

As we see, more and more people are shifting to so called higher status jobs, making jobs at lower level low in supply. We give a job advertisement in a newspaper and find there were around 100 applications for computer specialist, 20 applications for mechanic and 5 applications for washing. Probably that sections of people do not have access to these advertisements. Whatever it may be, but there clearly seems to be a high demand of such people who can do a satisfactory so called ‘low status’ jobs.

I personally have seen many housewives not satisfied with the work of ‘Bai’, may it be cleaning house, washing clothes, washing utensils etc. Sometimes the work is not upto the mark, low attendance and no punctuality.

What if we train people seeking to earn their livelihood for such work and provide this service instantly on demand. What if we dignify such work. What if such people are also given respect. What if it helps in bridging the gap between rich and poor. This could be a solution to better this world.
