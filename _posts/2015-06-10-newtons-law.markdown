I am feeling quite weird. One part of me says you should rule the world, while other makes me feel so small that I am scared to even get out in the wild. I felt strong and confident when confronting with my family about me wanting to do something, while I lay in the corner of a room thinking, now what. I imagine a lot, dream a lot, which takes me to the top of the world, but brings back to brutal reality with I born again. When today, I am allowed to fly, I fear, what if I fall, even though I am pretty sure, I am not going to die.

For the first time, I see a practical application of Newton's Law. There are equal and opposite forces acting on me, waiting for me to take a bold decision. I know things are not going to be smooth either way. Why not just take a chance and see what future has in store for me.

So I gave it some thought. I see two paths in front of me:
<ol>
  <li>Stay back and take up family business</li>
    <p>I have no doubt that this is the best option going forward. A ready business to learn from, experienced mentors (dad and uncles), support from family, freedom to experiment and a chance to lead a team. But a part of me wants to jump to option 2 for the very reason that I see something there. Don't ask me what.</p>
  <li>Fly away, take a chance to live my dream</li>
    <p>The great part about it is, I don't even know what my dream is. I want to build a company like Apple which designs beautiful products (I will talk more about it in another post). I have been thinking of this for a couple of years. Did I take any step towards is? Not really, atleast I can't specifically state any today.</p>
</ol>

I will probably get more clarity as I put out my thoughts one at a time. I am not sure if I am the only odd one here thinking such crap. Quite funny, right? Life is the best teacher one can get !
