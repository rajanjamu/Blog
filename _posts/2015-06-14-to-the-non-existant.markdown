God, why have you created me, why built a society around a me, why do humans love to live together, why are we social animals?

Why is that sons are produced in this world to fullfil dreams of parents and daughters for marriage? Why is it that it is very hard for parents to see their children away from them? If the wishes of one can't be fulfilled, why were we even brought in this world? For the first time I am talking to you, God, inspite of knowing that you don't exist.

Oh God, we all know that we will all die one day. All the hardships we think of today in our day to day life would never be remembered / appreciated by any. Human race may cease to exist one day. To ask how was I looking in a party would have no listeners. If you had the liberty to create us, give us the liberty to destroy ourselves. Is this society really doing good? Everything has changed and will keep changing. Please give society strength to change itself. What good is the religion that cannot keep their disciples happy? I request you to take me away, without disturbing the balance of ecosystem here. I have lost the strength to fight against this closely-knit net. I am unable to explain what's going on in my mind and heart. Give me either a talent to explain or a heart to listen.

And God, why did you show me big dreams, why did you give me confidence to achieve those dreams? Why did you bring great and inspiring figures to this world? Why do you show me a delicious peice of meat and not let me eat? Why did you give me wings with holes? Aye God, this is not fair. It really is not fair.

Come God. Meet me. Let's talk over coffee. I have many things to talk to you, lot of questions to ask you, many thought to share with you and anger to shower over you. Please bring along the holy book that you follow, a plan that you have for our planet, a vision statement that you wish humans had and a team of administrators you have.

Let me know when is the best time to chat. I shall make myself free from this society. Waiting for your reply!
