There must have been times in your life when there are far too many things hanging, waiting to take some shape, which you can appreciate. Though condition is not worse for me at the moment, but I feel the trailer.

I moved few days back to a city I have little known. There are far too many expectations back at home, or atleast, I showed an over-valued picture to my family, very confidently. I was even more confident about the team I was already working with. Without any gear, I set out on the journey. I am going to blow up and show the world who I am.

Team really is everything when you start. None else understand what we are going through. Specially when you are trying to build a business, future of which looks bleak, it may have emotional and pshychological effects on you. You, as a team, have to march past, look for gems on the way and keep growing.

What happens when you suddenly become insecure about the team you have choosen. You start to doubt many things in life. Even small things like getting an apartment, enjoying a movie, personal health, food, hanging out with friends become heavy. You keep thinking, now what? Is this why I left home? Picture of a confident dad and smiling mother keeps flashing in front of you, especially a mother, who used to smile openly to cheer up some last moments with her son in daylight and cry in the corners of room in dark nights.

One of my friend put it really well. "Rajan, you have entered a tunnel with a hope to reach out to other end of it and see a world you desire. You don't know anything about what lies ahead. Its pitch dark inside. So what do you do? You take out this small lantern, and lift it high in a hope to see what's out there. You know it very well that this light that it emits is just nothing when you see darkness all around you. But this small light shows you what's around you. With its help, you walk step by step towards the other end. Step by step, you feel enlightened and start learning the path ahead, step by step, baby steps you move and eventually you actually reach the other end of the tunnel. Don't be afraid. This small ray of light inside you is enough to walk you though your journey. May winds come, storm comes, protect this lantern, as this is the only thing that can show you the way. Fight hard for this lantern and unlock the doors to success one by one."

I know that this is not even 1% of what lies ahead. I know I will handle this. It can be very unpredictable, with constant on and off, high and low. And this may effect the surroundings, especially friends and family. I don't mean to hurt anybody. I really love going out with them. Even more, I sometimes try to pass few days to live these moments.

There are lot of dots floating around. Dots may not settle down for me to connect. But I will soon learn how to jump from one to other.
