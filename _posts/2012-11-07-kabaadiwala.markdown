Sounds cheap? What if this can turn out to be a great idea!

There are many things that we shell out everyday out of our households or offices which have either become obsolete or are useless. Obsolete but useful to others may be sold to the so-called ‘Kabaadiwalas’. They then sell it either to those who need them or to the recycling companies. Can you smell the scent of ‘Sustainability’ here? What I am trying to point is what a section of people feel unimportant may turn out to be useful for others who cannot afford to make a first hand purchase. Aren’t we reducing the gap between rich and poor here? And this business has been proved in the history by these Kabaadiwalas.


However, the system is not in place and is not easily accessible in most of the Indian cities. What is needed is the link between procurement of resources and needers. Instead of providing an end to end solution, we can just act as mediators and let people procure and sell. I am sure there are many out there who will be willing to do it for their livelihood.

This system can slowly take the shape of recycling and waste management, which will prove to be a boon in this world of high consumerism. Again, this task doesn’t come without challenges and it is very easy for me to sit and express it. There is whole lot of supply chain, customer identification, technology, social and practical aspects involved.

What we will be trying to achieve with this, most importantly, is providing employment. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, it will bridge the gap between rich and poor, provide poor with something that they cannot afford, a chance for people to contribute to the society.

There are many such systems already existing in metropolitans where the need to manage waste has taken utmost priority. It is, probably, time to take it global and take initiative before the problem goes out of control.
