Oh Maaa, Oh Maaa

Long since I have been away from home, I never missed you. I never thought about you. Doing shopping for you whenever I was out of India was a kind of compulsion as I knew you would ask, "What did you get for me, my son". I don't know the last time I called you. I never called you Maaa, but only Mummy. As the word Maaa was reserved for my grandmother, who was the greatest living being for me on this earth.

But today, I am missing you so much Maaa. Why are you so nice to me? Why do you pretend to be so bold and happy in front of me, and cry out your unhappiness when you are alone in the night. You are so nice to everybody. Your heart is clear as crystal.

Inspite of all this, I don't call you. Actually Maaa, I am shy calling you. I am shy calling anybody without any work. I know its weird. But you stay very very special to me Maaa, more as the day passes without you. I hope this letter reaches you someway. I will do something great for you someday.

Thank you Maaa
