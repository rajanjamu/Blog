This was my dream. I was Steve Jobs. How I created the next Apple. How I build the best team ever. How brutal I was about the way things are around me. How I agitated a comfortable setting into chaos? How sudden were my decisions. How fearless and bold I was. I was riding on a big wave. Revenue was 10x every year. And it all seemed so natural to me, but world thought I was weird !

<h4>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. <span class="author"> - Steve Jobs</span></h4>
