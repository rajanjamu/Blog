Main screen on my mobile shows 342. Time is ticking as if every moment is important. End of every day seems like year ending, and thought pops up in mind, "One more day over". I need to stay cool and calm, and not carried away by unneccesary pressures which may lead wrong results. There are days when not much work gets done, while some which leave me in awe. Obviously, success doesn't come overnight. And if does, its temporary. I want to be planning for next 10 years, and not be constraint to think only a year ahead.

Anyways, I have stopped caring much about the society. I already have many important people against me. One more down yesterday. So, it doesn't matter any more. Good part is, it makes me pshychologically free.

Path is going to be a bit tricky. Myself, with imature heart, confident mind and smiling face, am trying to make a dent in the universe, one step at a time :)
