I have been reading Zero to One for quite sometime. This is one of those books where I have to pause very frequently to digest what author is trying to convey. Some of things that he says are quite contrary to what this conventional world of startups in Bangalore believe in.

Reading this book, I have started enjoying the ride agains the tide. It might sound stupid, and yes, I am experiencing this stupidity. And I like it. I listen and understand what people are saying, but at the same time, don't give a damn about it. Learning is so much fun. People so want to teach, express their knowledge and like people who listen. They just open up their heart. Life is awesome, so are people.

I have no idea where am I heading to, but at this moment I don't care. I am living the moment. There are burning questions that keep circling in my mind, and I keep looking for answers. For the first time, I am enjoying uncertainty, which has become a driving force. I don't fear failure.

I, today, have a conviction. I know that there is a hidden secret. I left a comfortable position to look for that secret. And I know that I will find that secret. Unaware of how the destination would be, I am certainly enjoying this beautiful journey.
