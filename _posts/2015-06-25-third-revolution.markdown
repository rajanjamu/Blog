I have just started reading book - The Innovators by Walter Isaacson. Today, as we are riding on a wave of third revolution, I was curious to know how first two revolutions came to be. What led people innovate, how various bubbles join together to become a great ocean? How much time does it generally take for a revolutionary idea to mature? Where did the seeds of innovation? What did innovators of that age thought?

It is said that it took 100 years after Charles Babbage, along with Ada, to conceptualize a computer. There must be many in between who have gone by, tried various things with a mix of successes, failures, excitement, depression, temporary bubbles and suicides.

I am excited to be a part of this revolution and want to see how I can contribute to it. Nobody can be certain about success or failures. We can imagine a definite future and hammer the world to take that shape. In today's digital world, there are many external forces that are acting simultaneously and has made it easy for the ecosystem to grow at an exponential rate.

We need innovators to kickstart the revolution, entreprenuers to keep it fueling at its nascent stage and business people to sustain it in the future. This is the period to not race or compete, but to join various streams of small water bodies and make it big enough to be worthwhile for humanity.
