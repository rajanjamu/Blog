Let me tell you a story. An elephant gave birth to a baby. From the day one like its dad, baby's legs were tied to a small pole hammered in sand, so that it doesn't wander around and get lost. Years passed. Decades passed. Baby is now pretty strong and giant. Even today, same elephant is tied to the same pole. To break open that pole is a very mundane task for it today. But it thinks, "I have never been able to break it open so far, to try is waste. This is my destiny".

Please, do not cut wings of this generation by keeping them tied to a pole. Keep a balance of control and freedom.
