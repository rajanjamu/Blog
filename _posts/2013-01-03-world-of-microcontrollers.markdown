Until recently, I had been working on Atmel microcontrollers during my under-graduation. Having placed in a company which has been using PIC microcontrollers for their products, there is a change in the whole setup. It is taking quite some time to get comfortable with this new family and understand its internal structures.

Microcontrollers have always been fascinating me because of their ease of use and wide range of applications. Provided you have knowledge in this field, it takes very less time, effort and capital to come up with a prototype of a product. The world is slowly moving towards automating most of our daily activities and most of the devices demand mobility. There is also a lot of focus on environment which again makes the use of such embedded systems necessary.

Microcontrollers along with mobile applications, various output and input devices, web connectivity and simple innovation makes it one of the hottest topics to talk about. It opens up a whole new world of opportunities before you.

I am currently working on a simple project of keeping a fluid-filled-container at a constant temperature for testing purposes. A good project to start with.

Hope you are having fun :)
