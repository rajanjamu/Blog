I was working on a product which is targeted at improving quality of health in rural areas. As in every product cycle, product needs to be tested and validated in all respects with end users before being launched commercially, thereby giving me an opportunity to visit a village. It was situated around 30 kms from Bangalore, quite away from the ‘running’ world. Reaching there felt as if life has come to a halt. Nobody seemed to be as busy as people in cities. Few were taking naps under the shade of the tree while others were resting under the thatched huts in veranda  seemingly lost in the thoughts. People could hardly be seen on the roads. Houses were built well apart unlike multi-storeyed buildings in cities. Architectural designs of the houses was speaking well of their traditions. Rangolis was very common, all the houses seemed to have atleast one, reflecting their customs.

Quite contrary to what I thought that they (people from rural areas) may not treat people from cities well and may think that they are here to exploit us, they were welcoming. Every action of theirs was reflecting courtesy and respect. I felt overwhelmed as it has become rare in rapidly developing cities. Inspite of living away from all the comforts we enjoy at our disposal, they seem to be satisfied with what they had and living happily with families, close relatives and neighbors. Most of the mothers were happy to interact with us without any hesitation and gave feedback about the product. One of the them offered us lunch, while other gave us lemon water in the scorching heat, which I can confidently term as ‘Amrit’. Unexpectedly, they wished us that we be successful in our project and save babies around the world.

One thing that you will always notice in villages without fail are lovely children, ranging from small cute baby to the one who dominates the group. It might be fascinating for them to see people from cities, dressed in an awkward manner, speaking unknown languages, carrying mysterious gadgets and making weird facial expressions. Being among them, there would be moment when you would also wish to be back to your childhood, be in the grasslands, run around without footwear, play without rules, behave without caring about others, have funny body language, get into anybody’s house without fear and where getting scolded is everyday’s business. Though there is no common speaking language, expressions are more than enough to converse. I use photography to mingle up with these  lovely kids and enjoy invaluable moments.

At times I wonder, we are trying to make this world a better place by inventing new technologies, coming up with new ways to solve global problems, innovate to improve comforts etc. Isn’t this comfort relative? Howmuchever we aspire, we are never going to achieve what we aim, and people can still be better off (like what I explained earlier) with what is available, they can still be satisfied with what they have. Strange is this world. Strange is this Human !
