<h4>What is this review’s main message?</h4>
Rajan has done well in executing his various responsibilities and exceeds the reviewer’s expectations. He independently created a detailed project plan, proactively and regularly flagged key project issues to the manager, exhibited flexibility when changing project direction and saw his projects to completion (except for disposable liner, which was put on hold due to timeline constraints). His proactive approach helped create a good performance standard for the team to aim for and motivated team members. This is commendable, particularly given that Rajan is relatively less-experienced. If Rajan can address some of his weaknesses (highlighted in 3 below), he can become a more effective individual contributor and a great leader.

<h4>What are some key strengths of this employee (see performance criteria)?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Takes initiative and ownership</li>
  For each of his projects, he independently created realistic project plans, regularly updated the manager on the progress of various projects and saw his projects to completion (eg. velcro project). He also proactively flagged key issues and identified solutions to address the same. For example, when he took over Saranya’s project to water-proof BW, he quickly realized that her proposed solution was not working and came up with alternative solutions that he quickly prototyped (eventually did not work out because of technical/physical constraints). His proactive approach and strong execution capability enabled me to trust him with independence in executing his responsibilities. This freed up my time for other critical projects.
  <li>Positive team-oriented attitude</li>
  Rajan brings with him high levels of positive energy and enthusiasm that is really helpful to motivate a team. In addition, even at the cost of individual discomfort, he doesn’t hesitate to undertake new responsibilities that are important for the team’s broader objectives. For example, when Saranya left, Rajan, without hesitation, agreed to take over her projects, even though he knew that he would be accountable for projects that he didn’t start. This attribute makes Rajan an extremely valuable team player.
</ol>

<h4>What are some weaknesses for this individual to focus on improving (see performance criteria)?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Be comfortable with uncertainty</li>
  Rajan could learn to handle uncertainty in a better manner. For example, as we were facing road blocks in the disposable liner project, I found his energy levels and motivation dipping when the project path became very uncertain. He could have proactively acknowledged the challenges and course-corrected the project. As he takes on more complex projects, being comfortable with uncertainty and taking initiative to pivot/change the course of projects will serve him well in seeing his projects to completion. This attribute is also particularly important in the context of a start-up environment like ours.
  <li>Attention to detail in final output (particularly for written work)</li>
  For example, there were typos and other observable errors in Rajan’s test plans. These could have been corrected by paying more attention.
  <li>Communication skills</li>
  Rajan could learn to communicate more confidently, particularly with external parties. This is an important leadership attribute. For example, he could have been more assertive and confident in our discussions with potential vendors for the disposable liner project.
</ol>
