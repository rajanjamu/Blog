I was of the view that you should do things for free, try to prove yourself and once you have established credibility among your peers, they themselves will value you and give you what you are worth. Things will automatically fall in place. People around would understand and make you feel comfortable. This is the reason I did not feel it is important to talk about your stake in the company.

Also, I feel I have not been so good at negotiating, for the very reason given above. You don't have to negotiate to get things what you are worth. It will come, sooner or later. This whole process, I have come to realize, is a charity way, where you do things with the hope your hard work will bear fruits sometime soon. Sure, there is not problem in it, as long as the other person is not trying to exploit you. But who knows whom are you dealing with. In such cases, either be a person who is sharp enough to get into minds and tricks of people or talk clear.

Another way is to demand right away what you are worth and then get on to work. First question is, what am I getting in return. Are all the incentives aligned? Do I have enough stake in the company? Is company paying me what I am supposed to be? And this is a very clear discussion. Everybody is looking for something in everything, whatever it be, money, attention, power, status, publicity, love, compliment etc. This, I call it, a business way.

I seem to be going the charity way, and not the business way. Lets see, if that gets me what I want and where I want to be.
