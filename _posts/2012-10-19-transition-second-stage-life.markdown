It was quite easy to be a student with nothing to worry about and walk a path already laid out by others. Worries were just personal. You were the maker or destroyer of yourself. Social obligations were of hardly any importance. Moreover, it was a period when most were hardly worried about their career but busy in living the moments in a best way possible. Friends were all around. There were people of your age, caliber and sense to feel what you feel. A bunch of mad yet caring friends were ready to shout at you before you are sad. Emotions expressed found their way to some outcome. Immense opportunities with freedom to choose without any social limitation was usual.


And you are suddenly shocked as soon as you are out of your own world. People, imbibed in their own world of the institution called ‘society’, are waiting out there to teach you what society expects from you. Anything against them and you are at risk with lot of emotional jargons pouring in.

Point that I am trying to stress here is our own society that we live in. Individuals are still under its tight grip. Customs are traditionally being practised since long. Do they really carry any meaning in today’s world? Should they be given as much importance in this changing environment of our’s? What if they become a burden? What if their purpose is now distorted? I am not denying the very fact that it is these cultures that have kept us united. But what if that unity is not inherently a unity? What if it is these cultures and traditional thinking that keeps you from pursuing your dream?

India is still a developing country with stratification on the basis of occupation and religion quite prevalent. People still follow what others want them to follow. It is still these social status that matter to most people. They want their successors to carry on their legacy. What if next generation of an upper class business isn’t really interested and wants to get closer to lower class, understand their problems and provide them with solutions. But this transition of one such person in a big community can destroy the image of everybody directly or indirectly related. You then slowly start to be neglected in that very society that admired you earlier. But I may remind you all that history is full of examples of these odds who went on to make everybody proud.

Sometimes, there are genuine reasons which also turn against you. Society, sympathisingly   may not want you to get your hands dirty while you can lead a very good life with lot of abundance at your disposal. But what if you accept your life as a struggle in service to others? The world is probably forgetting that these young people, who are moving to their professional life, want autonomy and freedom the most. These limitations may effect not just their burning desire to fullfill their dreams, but also the same community in a long term.

“I do not want to be successful while following  your path, but enjoy those failures while listening to my heart”
