<h4>You can do world-class work or you can please everyone around you. But you can't do both <span class="author"> - Robin Sharma</span></h4>

I have seen many parents bragging about their obedient child who doesn't speak againt anybody, keeps everybody happy and tries to please all. Listening to these great qualities, child's mind is reinforced to keep this up and continue being like this. It is so strongly reinforced that this becomes the ultimate goal for the child in his/her life.

Great dreams get destroyed one after the other.
