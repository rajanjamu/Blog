I have never found myself ever in my life in such state of confusion that I am in today. I want to change the world, leave a mark before I die. Or, differently speaking, I never want to die and would want to be in the hearts of people forever. And this can be any mark as long as it’s the reason for smile on millions of faces. I am not particularly inclined towards changing lives of low income or disadvantaged people. I just want to bring a revolution that will be positively remembered by many. Steve Jobs is a great example that I want to be, actually much better than him. I will show the world that impossible can be possible. I want to be an inspiration of many. And I have confidence in myself that I will successfully do it. It’s definitely not possible alone. I will need talents from around the world and we together will make it work. I may be little inexperience at this stage to take any big step, but can definitely take small steps at a time.
Most people around me have stopped thinking big. They do not aim high. Society has trained all of us to be in our limits. What are these limits? Our thinking. Nobody believes that I can build a company at this time. Is it really true? Nobody believes that I can change the world. But this in no way changing my ambition.

I don’t know why I want to be the reason for millions of smile. I am not sure what is the reason I have been sent to this world. And making the difference that I explained above really is the purpose? And what would happen even if I achieve that? There is no limit to these ambitions, but still I am trying to get as high as possible in such a short time that I have.
I have been quite playful, enjoying every little thing in life. Many say I bring lot of energy to the surroundings. I do, but nobody knows where this is taking me. Is it coming at a cost? Am I aware of what I am going to do in life? Do I have a strategy? Do I have a plan? No. I am clueless of what I should do in life. I also do not know whether I should have a plan in mind or just flow with the wind and make best efforts wherever I am. They are sure conflicting arguments - Planning v/s Adventurous exploration. I have come to realize that there needs to be a plan in place for what you are going to become, else you may lose on best opportunities. A vague plan for next 10 years will help making best out of situations you come across. I can give one of the examples here. I graduated from IIT Madras and was selected for the post of software engineer at paypal. I did not take that up and started preparing for CAT. Then I later realized that this was not I wanted to get into. And here I waste precious 6 months.

I really come across things in a sudden manner because of not planning well. I am now in a situation where I want to go for higher studies and there is limited time. There are lot of things to juggle right now. Had I thought that this was the thing I wanted to get into, I would have started consulting people much earlier. I was just enjoying my life to the fullest, may be wasting life, and suddenly wake up to see that I am already late.
I also find conflict between my interest and my ambition. This may be short-sightedness but I really do not see myself aligning to that larger goal (goal that I have not yet defined). Whatever I am doing right now may add value but that’s so little that its not worth spending so much time on it.
It was really hard to come away from home, leaving my whole family, just alone. Parting from home was not normal. My views were completely different from what many members in family had. Mine is a business family and hardly has anybody gone for the job. My father, uncles and other indirect relatives have all been in their own business. Today, these have been run by their sons successfully. Its taken for granted that son will take this up later and take it further. Nobody believed in me doing a job. They were all against this idea of me doing a job. I also come from a family where society matters more than the interest of the individual. Society has so tightly grabbed each of the decision makers that independent thinking seems to have lost. Nobody thinks that there is just one life, actually few tens of years, given to us for exploring this beautiful world. It is because of this reason that we are not finding so many revolutionaries around us.

I claimed to build a company worth 200crores in 2 years of out of home. I currently see myself nowhere on that chart. I do not even have a path laid down that will take me there. I don’t even know if that is the thing I want to achieve.

And the whole thinking of the  family revolves around marriage. I have been told so many times to go to gym. It is perfectly great to maintain your health. But the reason? Reason is so that I can get a good life partner. Really? In such case, I don’t need a life partner. I can get around with happiness and sadness in my life. Why is it that daughters are not asked to aim high, start their own companies, explore this world in their own way? Because they are now at the age when they should be married. Isn’t that a lame thinking.

I know I am not serious about the responsibilities I have as a family member. I have pretty much ignored everybody in my family. I don’t call anybody. I never ask how they are. I never bother to even call when they are in pain. There is now lot of gap between me and my family. I do not feel like going back home. I do not recall missing anybody. May be, I am being selfish here that I use them for my purpose. I am just getting things done which I need to be done and not really helping them in anyway. Yes, I am selfish. If you do not want to help me, please do not.

And why is the blame put on me for my sister not being selected for CAT. I was not the one who chose to study with her. And if me studying with her created new complications for her, I am not at all responsible.
I still remember the day of Diwali when I was just mum, not talking to anybody, my father was angry with my attitude and I was like a lost body among strangers who is being kept in a cellar to be used in future for business. No. I do not want to be in that world. I am not made for that.
A very good question arises from this. If I am not even fulfilling my basic responsibilities, who am I to change this world. This very attitude of running away from responsibilities reflect that I will be a looser in whatever I do. May be. But I will be held responsible for my failure if I had chosen that path. And I have no problems in failing. In fact, if it was just the failure that I experienced in my life because of my decisions, if I did not go a steady path but took rocky and windy path even after many giving me strong suggestions, I will have smile on my face and proud in my heart while lying in my funeral ceremony that I did what I wanted, though it might not have turned out well. I am happy where I am and I do not care what the world thinks about me. Sure, many will spit at me then.

At times I really feel scared that there are so many things to do in life that whatever time I have is short. I need to become great quickly, make a positive impact, change the world and leave. Is that possible? Or was that notion true that everything happens in a slow and steady manner. Building solid foundation is very important. Or am I just cooling down from the energy I had when I graduated? Am I also becoming one of those people who settle down in their life with whatever they are earning, continue doing a job, without thinking of being the CEO of the very company they are in. 
There is a reason I have sit down today. I want to get my ambition clear. My goal in life should be crystal clear, atleast for time till I get any new information.

I want to be the reason, directly or indirectly, for smile on millions of people, who genuinely appreciate my work. I want to be in a position, equipped with sufficient resources to respond to any problem and offer solution. I want to build world’s best team with best turnaround capability for ideas to solutions. I want to wow people with solutions I offer. I want to bring in the technological revolution. I want to be the inspiration to many people. All this in a short period of time.

Talking about the confusion I have for the next step I should take in my life, it may not make sense to shoot an arrow in the dark without knowing what I am getting into. I am not sure what each of the higher study options have to offer me.
Few believe that whatever I am doing is completely useless and I have wasted being here in the company for past 10 months. Instead, I should have gone for higher studies and got exposure.

What I would like to be in next 5-10 years? How would I differentiate myself? What would be so cool and different about me?
