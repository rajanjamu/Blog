It looks like I am being thrown around by various people. That would surely happen in a city like Bangalore which is a home to diverse set of people. A must have skill is to figure out how to filter out noise. There are tonnes of opportunities but what are you if you keep jumping from one to other. At the end, you are neither an expert nor an all-rounder. It is important to look inside and figure out what you want to do with your life. Yes, there are many constraints and expectations, but you have to choose the best path through those obstacles.

Figure out what you fear the most, and tackle it head on. Sometimes you should switch from big picture and dig down into details to get things done. And it takes time to do even the small bit, you have to have patience and perseverance. Don't aim to be a billionare overnight. These news that we see everyday is front-end. We don't know what happens at the back-end and assume that because they did it, we can do so.

And you have already taken a jump, there is no looking back now. Either build a plane on the way or see your fate crushed in the hands of nature.

There are times when you will question your own decisions. Other opportunities will try to drag you. Stick to what you have decided. But if you have to pivot, do it. It is you who is taking decisions and you will be responsible for your fate. Choose wisely. Be clear. It is either yes and if it is not yes, its a no. There is no grey area.

Good luck my friend with you trying to make a place in this chaotic world. Even the weakest survive. You are in a much better position. You can do it. Just keep going, run or crawl, an inch at a time.
