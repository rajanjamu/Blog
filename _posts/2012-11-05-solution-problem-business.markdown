I am not really sure whether what is stated below is really a problem for others, but it is, atleast, for me. There is a daily routine that we follow and with that comes usual robotic tasks required to be done. Most important among them and common to all is the purchase of eatables, grocery, vegetables, fruits, dairy products etc. Most of us perform these tasks unintentionally and wish, deep inside, if we can outsource the same, provided we are personally satisfied with the service.


Some of the concerns, quite naturally, that surround us may be quality of the product, reliability of the service, price, time of delivery, accessibility, payment method, customer relations etc. At the same time, we have proven similar business like Pizza Hut, online retail marketing with home delivery and cast on delivery. What if we can borrow those principles and apply for this purpose. I understand, there are other issues to be tackled here. Products here are vulnerable in quality and may have lot of variations which allows loopholes. But probably thats the challenge.

I wonder why this market has not picked up yet. Probably, my understanding of the problem at hand is too narrow to make constructive arguements or this is not a problem at all for many.

Other than visible advantage of easing people with daily life activities, there are lot other things that we will be trying to achive here. Firstly, we consume lot of harmful packaging material when we individually buy various groceries and vegetables. Here, the same can be re-used in case of home delivery, thereby ensuring environmental citizenship. Secondly, because it is a big market, bulk purchase in a go can alleviate traffic congestion and pollution. Thirdly, as people will be concentrating on their core tasks without any major disturbance, productivity would increase, therby contributing to the nation’s economy. Fourthly, the very evident one, it will provide employment to many.

This is the problem that I see many face everyday, solution to which is called ‘Business’ and the breed of people who provide solution  are called ‘Entreprenuers’. Hoping for a better tomorrow !
