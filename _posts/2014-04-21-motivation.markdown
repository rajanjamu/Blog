No guys. Don't look for 'that' motivation. A letter to explain my inner calling !


Hey Priya,

We sort of left this discussion in between. Let me elaborate on my motivation. Please don't laugh. Many think I am just day dreaming.

<h4>Long Term Goals</h4>
I want to rule the world through hearts of people. I want to be the reason for smile on millions of people. I want to build great products that touch people's lives and bring about positive impact on a huge scale. I want to die big. I want to build great teams that can do magic. I want to enable interesting people to do interesting things. I want to be in a state where I would be adequately resourceful and not be constraint, If I have to improve the status of the society.

I don't think of being the one as mentioned above every month, I think of it everyday. This is so strong a motivation that has led me to leave my home inspite of immense pressure from the whole joint business family. And I am ready to bear the cost of not ever going back if it need be.

I know the goal is quite vague and not specific. Let me see if I can get a bit specific.

One of the obstacles that I came across in achieving this goal (though not specific) is not having such people around me who are crazy enough to think like this. I want to bring together such people who want to change the world but cannot cross the initial barrier, equip them with tools to express their inner voice. That's where I got this idea of creating a platform where people from different background can come together and build what they like, MakerSpace. It will promote the culture of innovation and creativity, it will be a hangout place for great thinkers, futurists, ideators, executionists, tinkeres and many more. More than looking at it from a business perspective, think of me as a crazy person who wants to take it forward because I believe in it. I will soon (someday) answer your question of value proposition.

Let me try to keep the mail short.

<h4>Short Term Goals</h4>
As mentioned above, I wanted to surround myself with great people, contribute to their journey to change lives and hence this course. 

I am not really sure what expertise I bring to the table for the team, which I feel sorry about. It feels really bad when I am unable to live upto the expectation of the team.

Though I would be indifferent to take up any task, I would like to be very strong at creating business models. Let me go ahead with creating business model for marketplace. At the end, what will bring joy and satisfaction to me is being a part of a team who delivered a great solution (not product), i.e., TurnAround, to our customers.

Sorry for keeping it long.

Thanks Priya. I see a great leader in you. Truly inspirational !
